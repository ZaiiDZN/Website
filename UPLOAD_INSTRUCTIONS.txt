HOW TO UPLOAD
=============

HOME PAGE
---------
1. Put images in: images/home/
2. Name them: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, ... up to 15.jpg

NOTABLE WORK (REVERSED NUMBERING)
----------------------------------
IMPORTANT: Numbering is reversed! Newest pieces appear at top-left, oldest at bottom-right.

1. Upload in chronological order (oldest first):
   - First piece → images/notable-work/1/ (appears bottom-right)
   - Second piece → images/notable-work/2/
   - Third piece → images/notable-work/3/
   - ... and so on

2. For each piece folder:
   - Put main image as: 1.jpg
   - Put secondary angles/extras as: 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.
   - Put text data as: piece-data.txt (see TEXT UPLOAD section below)

3. When you upload piece 16:
   - Create: images/notable-work/16/
   - It will appear at top-left
   - All other pieces shift down
   - Bottom row will have piece 1 (oldest)

4. Grid fills top row first (3 images per row)
   - Top row always has 3 images (if 3+ pieces exist)

TEXT UPLOAD (NOTABLE WORK & ITNFI)
===================================

For Notable Work and ITNFI project pieces, you can upload text data in a single file:

1. Create file: images/notable-work/1/piece-data.txt (for Notable Work)
   OR: images/i-think-narcissus-fell-in/1/piece-data.txt (for ITNFI)

2. Format the file like this:

title: Piece Name
size: 5.5 x 5.5 x 6.5
medium: Raku-fire Stoneware
year: 2023
description: Details about the piece.

3. Rules:
   - Each field on its own line
   - Format: "fieldname: value"
   - If a field is missing, it won't show in the overlay/page
   - Title is required (shows as "Piece Name" if missing)
   - Size, medium, year, description are optional
   - Description can be multiple lines (everything after "description:")
   - Leave size empty if you don't have size information

4. Examples:

   Full data:
   title: Reminder of the Past
   size: 5.5 x 5.5 x 6.5
   medium: Raku-fire Stoneware
   year: 2023
   description: Scars are evidence that wounds can heal.

   Minimal data (only title and description):
   title: My Piece
   description: This is a piece about memory.

   No size/medium/year - those fields won't appear in overlay/page

5. The system automatically:
   - Loads the text file when you click a piece (Notable Work)
   - Loads the text file on page load (ITNFI project)
   - Hides empty fields (no placeholders for missing data)
   - Shows only the fields you provide

6. ITNFI Project Notes:
   - Text files are stored in each piece folder (1/, 2/, 3/, etc.)
   - Same format as Notable Work piece-data.txt files
   - Currently used for reference/documentation

TIPS
====
- Keep file sizes under 2MB for faster loading

- Square images work best for design thumbnails
- Audio/video files should be reasonably sized
- The system maintains aspect ratios automatically
- Missing files show placeholders (no errors)
- For Notable Work: Upload in chronological order (1 = oldest, 15 = newest)
- Text fields are optional - only include what you have
- ITNFI piece descriptions are stored in piece-data.txt files in each piece folder


QUESTIONS?
==========
The system is designed to be zero-configuration - just drop files in
the right folders with the right names and refresh your browser!
