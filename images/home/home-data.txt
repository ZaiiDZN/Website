name: zaivion hampden.

about me:
Born in Brooklyn, NY, I am a ceramicist who explores emotion and statement through clay. My work embraces imperfection, as our shortcomings are also part of our story. I aim to make pieces that feel alive, raw, and otherworldly. Ceramics has become not just a hobby, but a true part of my very being. It pushes me to confront myself and learn to be patient with myself on the roller-coaster of life. 
I also study Architectural Design at Brown University, where I have learned key design principles that help me understand the discipline, as well as improve my own creative process. Architecture is like ceramics in many ways. One creates a vessel for any given purpose, whether for living or for plant potting. In some ways, when I make pottery, I feel as though I am constructing a home for the emotions or the items the piece intends to hold. 

current work:
Zaivion has just completed his first collection, I Think Narcissus Fell In, marking the beginning of a new era. This era is defined by a new understanding of ceramics, where he explores new techniques and media to improve his ability to evoke emotion with his art. Currently, he is pursuing his degree and his art abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. While traveling, Zaivion plans to utilize his experiences abroad to inform new work and possibly a new collection. Once summer begins, Zaivion will resume commissioned work.
