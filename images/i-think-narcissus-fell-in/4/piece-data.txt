description: I think of what awaits me,
in the quiet of the forest.
But I remember you,
and our dance continues.
It frees me from burden,
but not my convictions.
The fire keeps them away,
but prying eyes linger.
What will become of me,
of us, when this is through?
I try not to dwell–
We dance through the night.
