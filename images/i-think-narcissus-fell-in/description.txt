I Think Narcissus Fell In is my first-ever directive collection, spanning 6 pieces designed and created over 3 months. The body of work draws on the Greek myth of Narcissus, subverting the idea that he died staring at his own reflection by instead posing that he died in an attempt to find it. The project was imagined in mixed media, with works spanning ceramics, poetry, graphics, and audio design. Having never seriously branched out with other media, this was a true challenge to my creative process. Reflecting on the journey of creating this collection, I've gained a new understanding of how to convey emotion in different ways, and this can only make me a better self-proclaimed 'artist'. 

Dedicated to my Mother and Father, who brought me into this world to create.
Rest in peace, Dad.
