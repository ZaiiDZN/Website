"Ego is never truly the result of bad character, but rather the protection of a weak one. To be true to oneself, one must tear down their Ego and confront all flaws. Cleanse yourself, become anew."

Embark on a journey to find yourself, encountering the manifestations of your flaws. Each piece is a manifestation of some part of you. Let them, the pictures, and the audios paint the scene of each moment in your journey. Some parts are scarier than others, but how else can you grow if you do not learn to accept the good and the bad?
